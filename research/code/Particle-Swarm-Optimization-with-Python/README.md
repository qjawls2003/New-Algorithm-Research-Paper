# Particle Swarm Optimization with Python

These files accompany a series of tutorials that I created to cover the topic of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) written in the Python language.

This is a bare bones PSO implementation. It is useful to anyone new to PSO and looking to get a good understanding of how it works. The tutorial can be found here: https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-08-17/simple-particle-swarm-optimization-with-python/
